# Epub Reader Application

## Overview

This project is an open-source EPUB reader application built with React and [ePub.js](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js). The goal of this project is to provide a customizable, user-friendly interface to read EPUB books in your web browser. With built-in themes and fonts, it aims to make the reading experience as pleasant as possible.

## Features

- **Themes**: Switch between three themes (Light, Sepia, and Dark) to adapt the reading environment to your comfort.
- **Table of Contents (TOC)**: A convenient TOC for easy navigation between book chapters.
- **Paginated Navigation**: Navigate through the book pages using the next and previous buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on different devices.
